This is a personal site with a list of recipes that Melissa and I like.  
This will also serve as my learning to design a clean and easy-to-read food/recipe site template.

### Ideal Version

- Home page

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (version 16 or higher recommended)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed (optional but helpful)

### Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/leehongc/BooBaLoosKitchen.git
   cd BooBaLoosKitchen
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This will start the Vite development server. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or the port shown in your terminal).

4. To build the project for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

5. (Optional) Preview the production build locally:
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```

### Folder Structure
- `src/` - Contains the source code (components, styles, assets, etc.)
- `public/` - Static assets available in the build
- `vite.config.js` - Vite configuration file
